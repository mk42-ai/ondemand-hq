## 2026-07-19 01:31 UTC — MSM Analysis integration (recovered feature merge)

**What:** Merged the MSM Analysis module — the only surviving copy of which lived in the
divergent working-tree snapshot `code-files-20260718-091224_v1.zip` (2026-07-18 ~09:12 UTC),
never committed to git — into the mainline at checkpoint 70146e2.

**Why it matters:** The module adds a daily mainstream-media monitor (broadcast transcription
→ AI analysis → newsroom dashboard) and an "Analyse deeper" bridge that grounds chat answers
in stored broadcast transcripts. Losing the snapshot would have lost the feature entirely.

**How (non-regressive merge):** 22 MSM-exclusive files copied verbatim; 4 existing files
received additive-only wiring (route registration, sidebar button, SPA route + render branch,
style block). No repo file newer than the zip was overwritten — the newer X-data feed, intel
fixes and checkpoint notes are untouched.

**Model config:** `predefined-gpt-5.6-sol` endpoint + documented top-level `reasoningEffort`
(low|medium|max, default medium) via the shared `streamQuery()` — zero undocumented params.

**Verification:** node --check pass on merged server files; Vite build; fresh Vercel sandbox
deploy with HTTP 200 checks on /, /api/health and the MSM routes (timestamps in NOTES.md and
the run response).
